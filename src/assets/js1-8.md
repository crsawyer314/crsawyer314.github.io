# Module 1 - Lesson 8
##  For Loops

### Learning Objectives:
* Use a for loop with an array to update information on the web page


### Introduction/Warm Up

Use a for loop to log a list/array of fruits to the console

### Lesson

* Button html elements with ids and event listeners
* prompt() use and warnings
- Not for prod code, but a good learning tool
* String manipulation for I/O
* Combining tools learned
- Button + event listener = prompt + for loop -> string manipulation + (answers) array -> update innerHTML for results


#### Assessment

Each lesson will be followed by a short assessment to help you know whether you have mastered the material. This is completely optional, but we encourage you to take the assessment as many times as necessary to get all questions correct - and understand where the answers are coming from.

MC - multiple choice
MA - multiple answer
SA - short answer


1. (MC) What does the following code output? (if there are errors, what are they and how would you fix them?)
~~~js
let text = [1,3,5,8,43];
for (int i = 0; i <  text.length; i++){
    console.log(myArray[i]);
}
