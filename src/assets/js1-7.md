# Module 1 - Lesson 7
## Arrays

### Learning Objectives:
* Use querySelectorAll to change multiple objects at once
* Use an array to update information on your web page

### Introduction/Warm Up

Use querySelectorAll to grab all members of a class and change them

### Lesson

* querySelectorAll with classes and tags
* Compare to getElementByClassName
- Live collection vs not, changes to DOM reflection, etc
* Arrays
- Hand of cards
- Different types
- Store info in array and refer to it in setting elements


#### Assessment

Each lesson will be followed by a short assessment to help you know whether you have mastered the material. This is completely optional, but we encourage you to take the assessment as many times as necessary to get all questions correct - and understand where the answers are coming from.

MC - multiple choice
MA - multiple answer
SA - short answer


1. (MC) Which of the following is an array?
* a. `let a = [1,2,3,4]`
* b. `let b = {1,2,3,4}`
* c. `let c = (1,2,3,4)`
* d. `let d = <1,2,3,4>`



2. (MC) How could we select all of the list items in a page?
* a. `let v1 = document.querySelectorAll(“#title”)`
* b. `let v2 = document.querySelectorAll(“.lists”)`
* c. `let v3 = document.querySelectorAll(“.paragraphs”)`
* d. `let v4 = document.querySelectorAll(“li”)`


##### Project Acceptance Criteria:
* Change every element of a class with one interaction


##### Sample Project:

start creating a trivia game for your page; questions should be stored in an array
