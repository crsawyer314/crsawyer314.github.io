# Module 1 - Lesson 6
## Variables and QuerySelector

### Learning Objectives:
* Use querySelector to create variables
* Add event listeners to different variables
* Change different attributes of your website


### Introduction/Warm Up

Use an id to select an item and react to it being clicked

### Lesson

Use querySelector to choose elements by id or class

#### Subheading topic 1

Compare to getElementById and getElementByClass

#### Assessment

Each lesson will be followed by a short assessment to help you know whether you have mastered the material. This is completely optional, but we encourage you to take the assessment as many times as necessary to get all questions correct - and understand where the answers are coming from.

MC - multiple choice
MA - multiple answer
SA - short answer


1. (SA) What variable is selecting all list items from the page?
* a. `let v1 = document.querySelector(“#title”)`
* b. `let v2 = document.querySelector(“.lists”)`
* c. `let v3 = document.querySelector(“.paragraphs”)`
* d. `let v4 = document.querySelector(“li”)`

2. What is the first example on the w3Schools event listener page?

3. Read about event bubbling and event capturing on the documentation page. What do we need to do differently/add to the end of our event listeners to use capturing propagation instead of bubbling propagation?

##### Project Acceptance Criteria:
* Add a variety of events to page

##### Sample Project:

* Change font/color/etc styling and innerHTML when clicked
